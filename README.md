# Hack-4-Good Hackathon

# InclusionLab

## Problem Statement:
How might we, as a community empower , equip and co-create with persons with disabilities to enable them to access, use and enjoy places, services, products and/or information, whether physical or virtual so that persons with disabilities can connect to be included in the wider community?

## Why InclusionLab?
As we would expect most to target solution towards PWDs, our solution is mainly targeted towards the root of the problem which is to improve web accessibility in Singapore so that PWDs can have easier access to online resources which are extremely important in helping them to bridge knowledge gaps and connect with the wider community.

## What does InclusionLab do?
Users of InclusionLab are split into 2 roles, Assessors and Corporations.

The Asessors will be people with mild-minor disabilities. These assessors will look out for presence of accessibility features/tools, adjustable text size and high-contrast mode, clear and simple language).

The Corporations refer to companies keen on improving the accessibility and inclusivity of their websites. These assessors will look out for presence of accessibility features/tools, adjustable text size and high-contrast mode, clear and simple language)
